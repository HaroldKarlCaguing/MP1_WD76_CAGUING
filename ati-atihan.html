                <p class="card-text">Ati-Atihan Festival is the annual cultural and religious festival in honor of Santo  Niño in Kalibo, the capital of the province of Aklan in the Philippines, that is held every third Sunday of  January. Officially called Kalibo Santo Niño Ati-atihan Festival, it is considered the oldest festival in    the country, tracing its beginnings in pre-colonial era. It is often described as the Filipino Mardi Gras  with spectacles that resemble similar public celebrations that can be found in Latin America and the     Caribbean. Touted as the “mother of all Philippine festivals,” it is arguably the template from which   festivals elsewhere in the country are conducted particularly its use of visually striking costumes, parade,  and street dancing.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="card-title">History of Ati-Atihan Festival</h5>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">Ati-Atihan refers to “mimicking the Atis”, aboriginal native inhabitants of the island of Panay before the coming of the Malays and the Spaniards. Revelers wear body paints including blackening the face with soot and elaborate tribal costumes to achieve an appearance that looks like an Ati. It is also assumed that sadsad, the dance movement during parades, is an imitation of the gestures of the natives.

                In 2021 and 2022, activities were toned down in observance of minimum health protocols set by thegovernment to address the coronavirus pandemic. Activities were pre-recorded and live-streamed onvarious platforms. Major activities like sadsad street-dancing and food bazaar were cancelled to avoidforming of crowds.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="card-title">Fiesta of Santo Niño</h5>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">Oral tradition and written history give varying accounts for the beginning of the festival. Consensus on its origin indicates that it was a pre-colonial celebration, and Spanish invaders transformed it in ways to fit to Roman Catholic fiesta as a means to control the population socially and politically.

                Thus it developed into a celebration in honor of Sto. Niño, one of the many in the country includingCebu’s Sinulog Festival. The devotion of Sto. Niño in the Philippines sprang in Cebu in 1565 when itsimage was discovered in miraculous circumstances by a Spanish sailor in Miguel Lopez de Legazpi’sexpedition, reportedly the same image that was given to Hara Humamay by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="card-title">Renaming Ati-Atihan Festival</h5>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">Within the term of Mayor Federico O. Icamena, the yearly Fiesta of Santo Niño was renamed Ati-Atihan Festival in 1972 and became a more highly visual and public spectacle, incorporating elements akin to that of Mardi Gras. It gained national prominence by the performance of Kalibo contingents invited at the opening of Nayong Pilipino in Pasay City during Martial Law period.

                Much of the elements of the festival draw from its rich traditional accounts.</p>
                <br><br>
                Barter of Panay. It is said that the festival is a celebration that remembers how the native Atis supposedly peacefully ceded their lands. In 1212, ten Malay chieftains, their families, and retinue escaped from Borneo where they had been under the despotic Sultan Makatunaw of Sriwijaya era and set foot in Panay island. Their contact and negotiation with the Atis resulted in the exchange of lowland territories in favor of a golden headpiece, a gold necklace, weapons, other items, and a share of the annual harvest from the sea.
                <br><br>
                A feast was had involving singing and dancing that is said to be the first Ati-Atihan. The tale however differs in the particular detail of when the practice of blackface began. One account stated that the Atis relocated to the uplands and over time no longer attended the yearly commemoration of the barter, so the Malay settlers who continued the tradition started painting their faces black to remember them. And/Or that the Malays did have their skin darkened by soot on that very first feast in the spirit of celebration and communion with the natives.
                <br><br>
                The barter of Panay originated from Maragtas, a book written by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro who stated it was a compendium of legends and oral history. Historians said that its contents were from a work by Fr. Tomas Santaren first released in 1858. It is also the basis of Binirayan Festival of Antique.
                <br><br>
                Christianization of Kalibo. Another oral tradition stated that the settlement called Madyanos was renamed Kalibo which translates to “one thousand”, a reference to the number of natives who were baptized by Fr. Andres de Aguirre in 1569. After the sacrament Spanish colonizers and the new Christians began dancing in honor of Sto. Niño, a precursor of the present-day festivities.
                <br><br>
                Ibajay couple. A story penned by Fr. Jose Iturralde in 1975 mentioned that the festival began in Ibajay. A fisherman caught a log of wood which he tossed aside and then he went to sleep. Later, he and his wife woke up to a noise and discovered that the wood was carved in the likeness of the child. They treated the image as sacred and later transferred it to the parish. The townsfolk began blackface as propitiatory rite to appease the Holy Child from disappearing in the parish church only to show up in the house of the couple.
                <br><br>
                Blackface, sea attacks. An alternative explanation is offered by yet another lore. Ibajay residents started the tradition of blackface after they fought and defended their village against Moro raiders. They did so to avoid detection from the invaders, and they thanked the Holy Child who helped defeat the enemies. It is said that Fr. Fernando de Legaspi witnessed the yearly festival in Ibajay in 1798, and he then brought it to the towns of Malinao where he was assigned. Then, he brought the tradition when he moved to Kalibo in 1800. The festival was formally established through a declaration signed by church authority and the business elite of Kalibo on June 11, 1871.
